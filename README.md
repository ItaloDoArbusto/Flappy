## Running the code

This project does not currently have a formed installation method, so
the recommended way is to run the `src/main.py` file.

### Mac/Linux

First of all, it is necessary to install pygame, via (probably) pip.

```bash
pip install pygame
```

After that, just clone the repository and run the `main.py` file,
located in the `src` folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/italoseara/Flappy
cd Flappy
cd src
python3 main.py
```

You can also use `make` but the makefile is kinda incomplete.

### Windows

There's a script, `make.bat`. It might help you. In other cases, I'm
not sure on how to help.
