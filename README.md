## Runing the code

This clone does not currently have a formed installation method, so the recommended way is to run the `src/main.py` file.

First of all, it is necessary to install pygame, via (probably) pip.

```bash
pip install pygame
```

After that, just clone the repository and run the `main.py` file, located in the `src` folder.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/italodoarbusto/Flappy
cd Flappy
cd src
python3 main.py
```
